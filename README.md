# schematics-cookbook-examples

The point of this repo is to showcase the schematic collection that we walkthrough in my (book)[https://github.com/zbennett10/schematics-cookbook-examples.git]

You can buy the e-book (here)[google.com]!

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with
```bash
schematics --help
```

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.
